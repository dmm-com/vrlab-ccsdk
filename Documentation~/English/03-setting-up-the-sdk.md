# Setting up the SDK

The SDK is distributed through GitHub as a Unity Package Manager package.

Git is required and can be download by [clicking here](http://git-scm.com/).

To install the SDK add the following line to the dependencies in your `manifest.json` file:

    "com.dmm.vrlab.ccsdk": "https://github.com/dmm-com/vrlab-ccsdk.git#v1.0.1"

## Template Project

We prepared a template project that can be used as a base for your new worlds.

1. [Click here](../files/vrlab-ccsdk-template.zip) to download it.
2. Create a new folder for your project, extract the file in it.
3. Launch Unity Hub and add the folder you created to the list of projects.
4. Open the new project and Unity will import the SDK into your project.
5. Start creating!
